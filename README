R-packages
==========

This packages provides a convenient way (for me!) to install and update
packages for the R Statistical Computing environment. It contains a
hardcoded list of R packages that I use; changes in that list will cause
a version bump.

Installation
------------

Installation proceeds as usual with

    ./configure --prefix=<whereever>
    make
    make install

and installs a single script

    R-packages-update

which - if run from the shell command line - will update all R packages
in the current R installation. The script is intended to perform regular
updates of installed R packages.

A second make target,

    make install-packages

will install a hard-coded list of R packages; for details, see the list
of packages to be installed in `r-packages-install.R`.

Caveats
-------

There is a separate install script for `ROracle` which uses a patched
version of the officially distributed source code package. See the
`R-oracle-install.R` script for details.

And of course, the list of packages useful in my work might not be useful
for anyone else;-)

Dependencies
------------

These scripts were created for a Mac OS-X environment using Homebrew. The
following packages are required:

 - `r`
 - `netcdf`
 - `jpeg`
 - `gdal2`
 - `nlopt`
 - `udunits2`

That that `gdal2` is currently not available from `homebrew-core`, but by
tapping [`osgeo4mac`](https://github.com/OSGeo/homebrew-osgeo4mac).
